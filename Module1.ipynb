    "### Key uses of Python:\n",
    "- Developing web applications on servers\n",
    "- Building software workflows\n",
    "- Connecting to databases and modifying files\n",
    "- Handling big data and performing complex mathematics\n",
    "- Rapid prototyping and production software development\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Python?\n",
    "- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.)\n",
    "- Simple, readable syntax with fewer lines of code\n",
    "- Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming\n",
    "- Runs on an interpreter, enabling quick prototyping\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note:\n",
    "- Python 3 is the latest major version, though Python 2 still sees some use.\n",
    "- It can be written in text editors or IDEs like Pycharm, Thonny, and Eclipse.\n",
    "- Python uses indentation for scope instead of braces or semicolons, prioritizing readability."
